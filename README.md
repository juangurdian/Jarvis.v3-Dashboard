🤖 Jarvis AI Assistant

Jarvis is your voice-activated AI assistant powered by OpenAI, capable of real-time conversations, productivity management, and web integration. Built with STT (Speech-to-Text), TTS (Text-to-Speech), and a React + Flask architecture, Jarvis is modular and infinitely scalable, allowing users to extend its functionality with ease.

🌟 Features

Jarvis goes beyond simple conversation — it’s your productivity companion and digital helper. Here’s what it can do:

🗣️ Natural Voice Interaction
	•	Talk to Jarvis using your voice.
	•	Uses speech recognition (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) for hands-free communication.

📅 Google Calendar Integration
	•	Add, read, update, and delete calendar events.
	•	View events by date, range, or the entire week.

✅ Smart To-Do List
	•	Manage tasks with voice commands: add, complete, delete, and update.
	•	Tasks can include due dates and status updates.

🔎 Real-Time Web & Image Search
	•	Ask questions and get immediate answers or images from the web.

🎵 Spotify Control
	•	Voice-control your music: play, pause, skip, or check what’s currently playing.

🔕 Silent Mode
	•	Quickly toggle silent mode on or off.

📰 Crypto, News & Stocks (Under Development)
	•	Integration in progress for real-time market data and trending headlines.

🧩 Modular Function System
	•	Built to scale: Add your own functions with minimal setup.
	•	Every function is independent and defined in a structured schema.

📊 React Dashboard (WIP)
	•	Users will be able to drag and drop widgets to create their own custom dashboard.
	•	Widgets represent different assistant functions like calendar, to-do, weather, news, and more.

🧠 Running Jarvis AI

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis-dashboard.git
cd jarvis_dashboard

2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Run Jarvis core assistant logic (voice + AI engine):

python jarvis.py

4.	Run the Flask backend server:

python app.py

Flask handles all communication between the frontend and your assistant logic. It also exposes API endpoints for dynamic functions.

💻 Frontend Setup (React)
1.	Open a new terminal window and go to the frontend directory:

 cd frontend

2.	Install dependencies:

npm install

3.	Start the React dashboard:

npm start

To run Jarvis, you’ll need to provide your own API keys and credentials. Here’s how:

1. 🗝️ Create a .env File

Inside the jarvis_dashboard/backend folder, create a file called .env:
Then open .env and fill in your own credentials:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=your_spotify_username_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback

. 📁 Add Google Calendar Credentials

Jarvis uses Google Calendar. You’ll need to:
	•	Go to the Google Cloud Console.
	•	Create OAuth 2.0 credentials.
	•	Download the credentials.json file.
	•	Place it inside the following folder:

 jarvis_dashboard/backend/credentials.json

The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000 and connect to the Flask backend running at http://localhost:5000.

🧩 Add New Functions Easily

Jarvis uses a JSON schema for defining new tools. Each function contains:
	•	name: Identifier of the function
	•	description: What it does
	•	parameters: Expected input values
	•	returns: Optional output/response

Adding a function is as easy as:
	1.	Writing the Python logic.
	2.	Registering it in the assistant’s config.
	3.	(Optional) Creating a widget on the dashboard.
